# High Frequency Price Prediction

This is the Github repo for Yoshi's Island's CS155 Miniproject 1 code.

By using gradient boosting and feature extraction, we predict future 1-second price changes from order book data.

The Jupyter Notebook contains all of the relevant code, including the gradient boosting, feature extraction, and hyperparameter testing.
